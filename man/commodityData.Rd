\format{
A list containing three time series objects:

\describe{
\item{iPRECIOUSMET}{Monthly price index for precious metals}
\item{iNONENERGY}{Monthly price index for non-energy commodities}
\item{iENERGY}{Monthly price index for energy commodities}
}

Each time series starts from 1960 and has a monthly frequency (freq=12).

\description{
A comprehensive dataset capturing monthly price indices for various commodities
from 1960 to the present, as provided by the World Bank. This dataset includes
price indices for precious metals, non-energy commodities, and energy commodities.

The data was collected from the World Bank's Commodity Markets database, which
is widely recognized for its reliability and comprehensive coverage of global
commodity prices. The dataset offers detailed insights into long-term price
trends and fluctuations across different commodity groups.
}
\details{
The data has been preprocessed to ensure consistency and usability.
Price indices have been logarithmically transformed to address normality
issues and to better capture relative changes in prices over time.

\section{Data Collection}{

The raw data for this package was collected directly from the World Bank's
Commodity Markets database. It was then processed and analyzed using R Studio,
with the raw Excel file being read and transformed into time series format.
